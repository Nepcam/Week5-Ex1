# Week5-Ex1
Helping to write a simple appointment planner application to display a weekly planner.

For this exercise you will create a grid of squares representing an hour for each day. Monday is day 1 and Sunday is day 7. The
exercise will not involve interacting with the planner at all. 
The user should be able to specify how many hours per day to display. It will check if the value entered is between 1 and 24 
inclusive. If the value is valid then the planner is drawn based on the users input with weekday appointments drawn in 
White and weekend appointments drawn in Light Blue. If the value isn't valid, an appropriate error message is displayed. 
The application should calculate the width and height of an appointment based on the user's input and the size of the 
drawing area.
